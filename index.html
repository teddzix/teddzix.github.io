    <h1>Death ball</h1>
    <h2>A Competitive Dodgeball Arena in Roblox</h2>
    <p>Death Ball isn't just your average Roblox game. It's a thrilling, skill-based arena experience where players duke it out in intense dodgeball matches.</p>
    <img src = "img/icon.png" alt = "Аватарка игры">
    <ul><li>DODGE OR DIE: It's all about survival! Players wield powerful
         throwing balls and must dodge incoming 
         attacks while strategically pelting opponents.
          Aiming, timing, and quick reflexes are key to dominating the arena.</li>
        <li>ABILITIES: Death Ball isn't just about raw reflexes. Players can unlock
             and equip unique abilities that add strategic
             depth, like teleportation, shields, or even explosive
              throws. Think dodgeball on steroids!</li>
            <li>TEAMWORK: While you can go solo, teaming up with other players
                 brings out the true strategic potential. Coordinate
                 plays, cover each other's backs, and unleash
                  devastating combined attacks to claim victory.</li>
                <li>LIVES ON THE LINE: Unlike classic dodgeball, Death Ball features a life
                     system. Get hit
                      too many times, and you're out! But don't worry,
                       comebacks are always possible.</li></ul>
    <h2>MORE THAN JUST GAMEPLAY</h2>
    <ul><li>POLISHED ARENAS: Death Ball boasts visually stunning and atmospheric arenas, immersing you in the heat of the competition.
         From sleek
          futuristic architecture
           to neon-lit playing fields, it's a feast for the eyes.</li>
        <li>ACTIVE COMMUNITY: With a dedicated community of players, finding matches
             and making friends is a breeze. Join the ranks,
              test your skills, and climb the leaderboards!</li>
            <li>VARIETY: Whether you prefer close-quarters brawls or long-range sniping,
                 Death Ball offers a variety of maps
                  and game modes to keep things fresh and exciting.</li></ul>
